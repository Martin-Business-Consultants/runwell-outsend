module Outsend
  # Routes mail through Outsend while the plugin is on and has a key. As a Mail interceptor it
  # decides per message at delivery time, with the database at hand, so no restart is needed;
  # as an observer it records that a message went out. Development and test mail is left to
  # letter_opener and the test adapter.
  # Mail comes from the install's sender (Settings > Email), which must be on a domain verified in
  # Outsend.
