module Outsend
  # A Runwell plugin: outbound mail through Outsend (getoutsend.com). Paste the API key in
  # Settings > Outsend and every email the app sends goes out through Outsend's SMTP, from the
  # sender set in Settings > Email (tested there too). The
  # core's own SMTP settings, if any, only apply while the plugin is off. A Mail interceptor
  # decides per message, so switching the plugin on or off needs no restart. It owns one table.
